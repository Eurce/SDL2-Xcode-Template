SDL2 Xcode Templates
======================

SDL2 Xcode Templates for XCode (barely tested on 4.5.2) I'm not responsible for any harm done. Seriously.

To install the Templates, simply copy the Project Templates folder into ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates

Tah-Dah.

Now when making a new project in Xcode (4.5.2) , you will see a section SDL2. 

There are 2 different Templates, one for SDL2 Console application, and one for SDL2 Application.
The difference is that one is simply a command line app.
the other is an actual .app file (with the .app package hierarchy and all).

Feel free to try them both out and modify them to your needs. Havefun! If you have any questions... Hit me up!!!
